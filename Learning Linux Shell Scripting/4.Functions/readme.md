# Chapter 4: Functions

The “Functions” chapter in the “Learning Linux Shell Scripting” course dives into several key aspects of using functions in shell scripting. Here's a summary of what's covered:

## Contents

1. **Basics of Functions**: Introduces how to create functions in shell scripts, setting a foundation for structuring reusable code blocks.
2. **Using Parameters**: Explains how to pass parameters to functions, allowing for more dynamic and flexible script behavior.
3. **Piping**: Demonstrates the use of pipes within functions to process data in a streamlined manner. This includes taking output from one command as input for another, enhancing the script's efficiency and capability.

All the above concepts are combined into a single script for easier organization:
- [Script: functions.sh](functions.sh)

4. **Challenge and Solution**: Provides a practical exercise to reinforce the concepts learned in this chapter by creating a script with two functions: `GetFiles` and `ShowFiles`.
   - [Script: challenge_solution.sh](challenge_solution.sh)

This chapter equips you with the knowledge to use functions in your scripts, making them more modular, reusable, and easier to manage.
