# Chapter 2: Advanced Scripting Concepts - Control Structures

The second chapter of the “Learning Linux Shell Scripting” course dives into more advanced scripting concepts, specifically focusing on control structures like branching and loops. Here's a concise overview of the contents:

## Contents

1. **The if statement**: Introduces the basic conditional statement in shell scripting, allowing scripts to make decisions based on specified conditions.
2. **The else clause**: Expands on the if statement by providing an alternative path of execution when the if condition is not met.
3. **The elif clause**: Allows for multiple conditions to be evaluated in a single if-else block, enabling more complex decision-making processes.
4. **The while loop**: Demonstrates how to perform repetitive tasks as long as a specified condition remains true.
5. **The for loop**: Teaches how to iterate over a series of values or files, making it easier to perform batch operations.
6. **Using break and continue**: Explains how to control the flow of loops with break (to exit the loop prematurely) and continue (to skip the rest of the current loop iteration).

All the above control structures are combined into a single script for easier organization:
- [Script: control_structures.sh](control_structures.sh)

7. **Challenge and Solution**: Provides a practical exercise to reinforce the concepts learned in this chapter by creating a counter script.
   - [Script: challenge_solution.sh](challenge_solution.sh)

This chapter builds upon the foundational skills taught in the first chapter, introducing learners to the power of conditional statements and loops in shell scripting. These concepts are crucial for writing more dynamic and flexible scripts that can adapt to different conditions and automate a wider range of tasks.
