# Chapter 1: Learning Linux Shell Scripting Basics

The first chapter of “Learning Linux Shell Scripting” covers the basics of shell scripting, starting with the fundamentals such as printing messages to the console, changing file permissions with `chmod`, and introducing comments in scripts. Here's a brief overview:

## Contents

1. **Printing to the console**: Demonstrates how to display text on the terminal.
2. **chmod**: Explains how to change a file's permissions to make scripts executable.
3. **Comments**: Shows how to add comments to scripts for better readability.
4. **The shebang**: Introduces the shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`), which specifies the script's interpreter.
5. **Creating and using variables**: Covers how to declare and use variables in scripts.
6. **Passing parameters**: Teaches how to pass and use parameters in scripts.

All the above basics are combined into a single script for easier organization:
- [Script: basics.sh](basics.sh)

7. **Challenge and Solution**: A practical exercise where you create a script that accepts two parameters (a name and a favorite sport) and outputs a sentence using these parameters.
   - [Script: challenge.sh](challenge.sh)

This chapter lays the foundation for shell scripting, emphasizing hands-on practice and understanding basic concepts.
