# Chapter 5: File Operations

The "File Operations" chapter in the "Learning Linux Shell Scripting" course covers essential skills for reading from and writing to files, along with managing file checksums. Here's a brief overview:

## Contents

1. **Reading files**: This section teaches how to read content from files using shell scripts. A typical command you might encounter is `read`, used within a loop to process each line of a file.
2. **Writing files**: Here, you'll learn how to write to files, which might involve commands like `echo` for appending text or overwriting file content.
3. **File checksums**: Understanding how to verify the integrity of files using checksums is crucial for ensuring data hasn't been altered. Commands like `sha256sum` could be discussed for generating checksums.

All the above concepts are combined into a single script for easier organization:
- [Script: file_operations.sh](file_operations.sh)

4. **Challenge and Solution**: Provides a practical exercise to reinforce the concepts learned in this chapter by reading a text file and processing its content.
   - [Script: challenge_solution.sh](challenge_solution.sh)

This chapter equips you with the knowledge to perform file operations in your scripts, enhancing their flexibility and functionality.
