# React Native WebRTC News App

This is a **React Native** project that integrates **WebRTC** for real-time communication with remote hardware. The app fetches news data via a WebRTC data channel and renders it using a `NewsFrontPage` component.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that comes with React Native. Run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start

```
### Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
```bash
# using npm
npm run android
```
# OR using Yarn

yarn android
For iOS
```bash
# using npm
npm run ios
```
```bash
# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your app running in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly.

You can also run the app directly from within Android Studio or Xcode.

### Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit the necessary lines.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Windows and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes.

For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes.

### WebRTC Integration
The app uses WebRTC to establish a connection with remote hardware. The news data is fetched over a WebRTC data channel and displayed in the app using the NewsFrontPage component.

### Troubleshooting
If you run into issues, please refer to the React Native Troubleshooting page.
